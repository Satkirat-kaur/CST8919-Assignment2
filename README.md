## **1. Azure Active Directory (SSO, IAM)**

**AWS Equivalent:** AWS IAM + AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO)  
**GCP Equivalent:** Google Cloud Identity & Access Management (IAM)

### Overview
- **Azure AD:** Cloud-based identity and access management for authentication, SSO, MFA, and access policies.
- **AWS IAM:** Controls access to AWS services/resources with users, groups, roles, and policies.
- **GCP IAM:** Assigns permissions to Google Cloud resources via roles, members, and policies.

### Core Features
- **Azure AD:** SSO to 1000s of SaaS apps, conditional access, MFA, hybrid identity sync.
- **AWS IAM:** Fine-grained permissions, federation, temporary credentials, policy-based control.
- **GCP IAM:** Role-based access, service accounts, policy hierarchy, workload identity federation.

### Security & Compliance
All three meet major standards: ISO 27001, SOC, GDPR, HIPAA, FedRAMP (high), etc.

### Pricing Model
- Azure AD: Free tier + Premium P1/P2 per user/month.
- AWS IAM: Free; charges apply for AWS SSO with certain connectors.
- GCP IAM: No extra cost; included in Google Cloud usage.

### DevSecOps Integration
- Works with Terraform, CI/CD pipelines, and API-based role assignment for automated deployments.
